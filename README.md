# FractalTreeOLC
Simple script to generate a fractal tree. 
Hardest part was getting the rotation to work. If I'm not mistaken c++ does not come with a "rotation" function that does the work for you like some other languages out there. Feel free to improve upon it. One thing to try is making the angle interpolate between two values - see how it changes the tree.
